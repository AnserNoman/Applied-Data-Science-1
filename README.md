# Applied-Data-Science-1
This repository is dedicated to my Statistics and Trends assignment in Applied Data Science 1 subject. 
In this assignment, I took a dataset from Kaggle on Health and Sleep Statistics to apply some visualisation techniques and analise it's data.
I uploaded the data on my Jupyter, then read it in my new notebook after importing libraries.
After reading dataset in notebook, I did some basic funtions like,
df.describe()
df.info()
df.columns.size()
df.shape()
df.sum()
and the mathematical funtions I did were, 
df.min()
df.max()
coef_
intercept_
LinearRegression()
Hypothesis Testing
After this i deleted a coumn which was not of any use in our analysis like 'User Id' and updated the new datase.
Then I started Visualising through different techniques to get better results.
The notebook is attached in this repository and i will also be uploading code.
